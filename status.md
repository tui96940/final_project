Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have been able to successfully create a sudoku game in which each column, row, and box has one of each digit from 1-9. I have also been able to set up the game so that certain blocks are randomly left empty and the user can select a number and then the empty block to input the number. If it is the right number it will turn green, if it is the wrong number it will turn red.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to set up the option for the user to be able to select an easy or a hard game.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

While following a tutorial video, the dimensions they used were different, so I had to be careful to make sure I properly adjusted mine as needed. Additionally, with the amount of code done so far, typos have been a big issue.
