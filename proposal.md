# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Sudoku

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Sudoku game that has easy and hard versions.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use pygame to create the sudoku game. The player will have the option to play an easy game or a hard game. The main difference between these two versions will be the amount of numbers already filled in on the board. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I anticipate at the minimum being able to create a sudoku game (sans the different difficultly versions for the player to select between)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I finish the sudoku game with the option for the player to choose between an easy and a difficult version

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I finish both versions of the game and have it so that if the player inputs an incorrect number, the number turns red. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to download pygame, figure out how to make the graphic for the grid(s), how to get the computer to randomly provide a portion of the board pre-solved so that the player will be able to solve the game, and then provide the user a choice between an easy and difficult game
